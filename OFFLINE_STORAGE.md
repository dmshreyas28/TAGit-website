# Offline Storage Implementation

## ✅ Completed Features

### 1. Firestore Offline Persistence
- **Enabled unlimited cache** for Firestore
- Automatically caches all read data
- Works seamlessly when internet connection is lost
- Data syncs automatically when connection is restored

### 2. Local Storage Service
- **SharedPreferences** for quick key-value storage
- Saves user profile locally as backup
- Tracks last sync time
- Provides fallback when Firestore cache fails

### 3. Network Connectivity Monitoring
- **ConnectivityService** using `connectivity_plus` package
- Real-time monitoring of WiFi, Mobile Data, Ethernet
- Notifies app of connectivity changes
- Updates UI automatically

### 4. Offline Indicator UI
- **OfflineIndicator** banner at top of screen
- Shows "Offline Mode - Using cached data" when offline
- **CompactOfflineIndicator** for smaller spaces
- Auto-hides when connection is restored

## 🎯 How It Works

### Data Flow (Online Mode)
```
User Request → Firestore → Local Storage (backup) → Display
                   ↓
            Cache in Firestore
```

### Data Flow (Offline Mode)
```
User Request → Firestore Cache → Display
      ↓
   (If cache fails)
      ↓
Local Storage → Display
```

### Auto-Sync When Back Online
```
Connection Restored → Firestore syncs pending changes
                   → Local storage updated
                   → Offline banner disappears
```
