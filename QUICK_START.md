## 🎯 How to Run & Test

### Option 1: Run on Android Emulator (No NFC)
```powershell
# Make sure emulator is running
flutter devices

# Run the app
cd C:\Users\SHREYAS\Downloads\tagit_app
flutter run -d emulator-5554
```

**Note**: First build takes 15-30 minutes (downloads dependencies). Subsequent builds are ~30 seconds.

### Option 2: Run on Physical Android Device (Full Features)
```powershell
# Enable USB debugging on phone

```powershell
# Cancel and clean
Ctrl+C

# Clean build
cd C:\Users\SHREYAS\Downloads\tagit_app
flutter clean
flutter pub get

# Try again
flutter run
```

### If you see errors:
```powershell

flutter analyze

# Get detailed output
flutter run -v
```

### If Android build is too slow:
- **First build**: 15-30 minutes (normal)
- **Hot reload**: 1-3 seconds (after first build)
- Be patient with the first build!
